This represents my Bachelor's Thesis with the name: "Exploring the Visualization effect of asynchronous Playerâ€™s heartbeats in a virtual reality Escape Room on Social Connectedness". 

I created 5 escape rooms in VR, each solvable in 10-15 minutes. In each room I had the option to show a heart visualization from previous players who already escaped.
